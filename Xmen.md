## X-Men Cards
- Using `Backbone` and `Underscore` templates:
- Create a front end app ***Xavier's Institute of Higher Learning***
- Create an ***XMan*** model. There's some sample data below.
- Instantiate 3 instances of the model, each to represent a different mutant
- Give each instance its own attributes which represents its mutant abilities
- Give each mutant a catchphrase
- Create a single page app with all of the mutants.
- Clicking on a mutant should append that mutant's catchphrase to the speech bubble using some animation.

```object
mutants: [
		 {
			 name: "Wolverine",
			 ability: "Sharp things",
			 phrase: "I chipped a nail"
		 },
		 {
			 name: "Cyclops",
			 ability: "Laz0r eyes",
			 phrase: "I can't wink"
		 },
		 {
			 name: "Prefessor Xavier",
			 ability: "Mind laz0rz",
			 phrase: "I'm wearing pants"
		 }
	 ]
```
